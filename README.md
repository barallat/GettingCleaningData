## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
* Unzip the source
( https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip )

into a folder on your working directory, say /User/Ccoursera/Getting and Cleaning Data

* Place run_analysis.R also in the working directory and do: source("run_analysis.R")

* This will run the R script, it will read the dataset files and write these files:
      
      completed_data.txt  -- 8.35 Mb

      average_data.txt  -- 0.225 Mb

      The script normally runs for less than a minute, but this depends on your system.
